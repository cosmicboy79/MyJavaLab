# My Java Lab

Project to try out and to practice a bit Java features and frameworks:
a private, small "science laboratory", if you will.

As of now, the existing modules are:

1. [reactive](https://github.com/cosmicboy79/MyJavaLab/tree/main/reactive) - experiments on [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io).
2. [threading](https://github.com/cosmicboy79/MyJavaLab/tree/main/threading) - experiments on Java Multithreading.

This project is built with Maven and it uses Java 21.
