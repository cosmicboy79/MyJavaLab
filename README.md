# My Java Lab

Project to try out and to practice Java features and frameworks a bit:
a private, small "science laboratory" if you will.

As of now, the existing modules are:

1. [reactive](https://github.com/cosmicboy79/MyJavaLab/tree/main/reactive) - coding experiments on [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io).
2. [threading](https://github.com/cosmicboy79/MyJavaLab/tree/main/threading) - coding experiments on Java Multithreading.

This project uses Java 21 and Maven as build tool.
